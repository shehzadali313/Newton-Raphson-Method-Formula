# Newton-Raphson-Method-Formula
This is a MATLAB function that implements the Newton-Raphson method for finding the root of a real-valued function. The method uses the tangent line of the function at a given point to estimate the location of its roots, and iteratively refines this estimate until the desired level of accuracy is achieved.
